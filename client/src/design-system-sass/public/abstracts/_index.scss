// Abstracts
// =========
//
// This folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. 
// Every function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.
//
// NOTE: Variables should be placed in the /variables folder.
//
// The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single 
// line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.
